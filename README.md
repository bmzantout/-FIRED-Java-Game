# "FIRED!" Game
The Game's Story: A man stole 6 important documents from his company. But, a wind blow scattered the documents in random places on the street. Avoiding the police, collect the documents, answer the questions, and run to the car!


## Overview

FIRED! is a game developed with the intention of being an educational game in which the player controls a character (that character is shown as a businessman) that has to collect 6 documents randomly-scattered in a maze while escaping the police. When each document is collected the game pauses and only resumes once the player answers the question that appears at the right of the screen. The player looses from his 3 souls for each wrongly-answered question and at each time he gets in touch with the police chasing him. After the 6 documents are collected the player has to head to the car placed at the top right corner of the maze. The player should complete the given task in the shortest time possible (a timer is set at the start of the game). This game is written in Java and uses the Swing graphics library for rendering.
